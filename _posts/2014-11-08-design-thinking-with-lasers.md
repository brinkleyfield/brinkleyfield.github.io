================

<p class="meta">

<p>This class we'll cover high-leveling design thinking, process, making: both prototyping and visualization. Read Tim Brown's article: [Design Thinking]({{ site.url }}/pdfs/DesignThinking-Tim-Brown.pdf). We'll also relate some tools and techniques to your design process and this class.</p>

<p>Then we'll begin our 2-class journey into 3D modeling and prototyping with Rhino (3D Modeling software), with a workshop on Preparing a topographical map for laser cutting. And we will walk through the [laser-cutting process using the Trotec Speedy 300 laser-cutter](http://www.mica.edu/Academic_Services_and_Libraries/Fabrication_Studios/Digital_Fabrication_Studio/Laser_Cutters.html) in the MICA dFab Lab.</p>

<p>To prepare for class, please do the following:</p>
