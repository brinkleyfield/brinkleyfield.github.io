================

<p class="meta">

<p>For next week's presentations, use [this outlined format]({{ site.url }}/vispro14-blog/pdfs/Final-Project-Pitch-Template.pdf) to prepare your Final Project Pitch presentations.</p>

<p>This will be a timed presentation. You will have a total of 10 content slides and 20 seconds per slide. Your PDF and presentation need to contain the following:</p>

 - Project title, synopsis and motivation.
 - 3 Precendents for your project
 - A mind map of your project
 - A project matrix
 - An "analyze content" definition for your project
 - An outline of your data, where and how you plan to get it
 - A user / project flow sketch
 - At least one either 3D or 2D low-tech or high-tech prototype
 - Screenshots of your blog and how your are documenting your process
 - And a list of your next steps

<p>Please refer to the [Creative Process Lecture]({{ site.url }}/vispro14-blog/pdfs/04_CreativeProcess-Make-Document.pdf) for help.</p>

<p>After the presentations, we will cover the process for both laser-cutting a file and 3D printing a file. Watch [Chapters 5-9, 13, and 15 of Rhino 5 Tutorials on Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/Rhino-tutorials/Rhino-5-Essential-Training/133324-2.html) and review the dFab's [3D printing with RepRap tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PNLQDIsmqsAAF2RVv6AkO4g4ykQUuRjFS9C4x-rB9LM/edit).</p>

<p>After this class we will have no more demos and just focus on using the tools, reviewing your progress and working in class to make your final projects awesome.</p>
